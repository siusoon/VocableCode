  - https://dobbeltdagger.net/VocableCode_Educational/ (Demo, tinker, read, speak)
  - Live coding software: Vocable Code
  - Read code
  - round the table read aloud (around 5 sentences each)

#### **3. Doing - Write your own sentence with the following rules:**
  - write here collaboratively (Chrome / Firefox): https://demo.webstrates.net/sweet-dolphin-63/

#### **4. Read aloud + share**: round the table sharing the individual sentence:

#### **5. Online performance:** intervening your own queer code:
    - think of possible strategies (voice and visual)
    - repetitions
    - temporality
    - how to move the post-it and in relation to your voice
