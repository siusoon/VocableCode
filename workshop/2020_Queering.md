  - Vocable Code: http://siusoon.net/vocable-code/
    - software art + codework (web ver for workshop: https://dobbeltdagger.net/VocableCode_Educational/)
    - critical interfaces
    - physical book/performance lecture with Geoff Cox: https://dobbeltdagger.net/publication/vocable-code-13082018

  - Voices and Languages:
    - audio-visual literature (with text and audio)
    - contribution of voices and statements: "Queer is..."
          - https://github.com/siusoon/VocableCode/blob/master/vocablecode_program/voices.json
    - code as language
      - coding as writing?
      - what's the language structure? and how is that influenced the way of thinking? (e.g gendered objects, the English pronoun he/she etc)
      - what is the underlying structure of computer programming, and what's the implication of some common programming practices
    - source code as codework, Speaking Code: coding as Aesthetic and Political expression (by Geoff Cox):

    > computer programs have bodies in the sense that other materialities and meanings are deeply interwoven, and these necessarily exist as part of wider social relations

    > Through the connection to speech, programs can be called into action as utterances that have wider political resonance; they express themselves as if possessing a voice

#### **2. Vocable Code/Speaking Code:**

  - Live coding software: Vocable Code: https://dobbeltdagger.net/VocableCode_Educational/ (Demo, tinker, read, speak)
  - Namings and Structures
  - Read aloud: (around 4-5 lines each)

#### **3. Doing - Write your own sentence with the following rules:**
  - write here collaboratively (Chrome / Firefox - disable your ad blockers): https://demo.webstrates.net/sweet-dolphin-63/

#### **4. Read aloud + share**: round the table sharing the individual sentence:

#### **5. Online performance:** intervening your own queer code:
    - think of possible strategies (voice and visual)
      - repetitions & temporality
      - Pause | Speak | Pitch | Sing | listen
      - how to move the post-it and in relation to your voice
